## About

Over 160 of South Florida’s most elite software designers and engineers gathered along with participants from Argentina, Chile and Colombia at the University of Miami Life Science & Technology Park in downtown Miami for the 2012 AT&T Mobile App Hackathon. Competitors had 48 hours to concept, design, code, and present their idea to judges from local tech startups – in hopes of taking home over $5,000 dollars in prizes. The Miami Herald did a great write up.

My team created an app called Crystalize, which ended up taking home the silver medal. Crystalize is an idea catalyst: it makes good ideas great, and makes great ideas happen. It’s an iPhone app that helps you catalog your ideas and distill them down to make them successful. It’s for people with ideas: inventors, entrepreneurs, students, and daydreamers. It asks you a series of questions to help you develop and validate each idea. When you’re done, it compiles a professional PDF executive summary to print or email. For a fee, you can confidentially submit the idea for review by a business mentor.
